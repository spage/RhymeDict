NOTE MY has 10 SUFFIXES prolly max, oops. TRUE has 12 suffixes
SO do SUFFIXES NO numbers, suffix list separator, use numbers > 0 as above
SORT SUFFIXES DEFINITELY BY ORDER OF USAGE in MY list -y has 18 of the 39 words
that many suffixes blows my bit budget no  5 bit compress 32 - (a-z 26) = 6 - (1 sep) = 5 - (1 ain't) = 4
...so use 6 bits, pack and hexencode datablock


Start with about 7500 one syb words worked down to 3500
start with abuot 16000 two syb words, two will be quite a challenge!
